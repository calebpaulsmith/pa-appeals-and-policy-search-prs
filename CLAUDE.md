# CLAUDE.md

## Purpose

This file is intentionally committed at the repository root as operating context for Claude Code or another coding agent working in this repo.

Do not copy this file into the Databricks product folder when moving only that folder into another repository or workspace. It is repo-level engineering guidance, not a deployable app artifact.

## Product Goal

Build `pa-appeals-and-policy-search` into a professional, efficient, FEMA-wide search product for Public Assistance appeals and related policy PDFs.

The target user experience is:

- deterministic legal-style search for exact phrases, boolean logic, proximity, wildcard, and frequency queries;
- semantic search over embedded PDF chunks;
- source PDF preview by document and page;
- one-button onboarding of new PDF stacks;
- governed access through Databricks Unity Catalog;
- clear operational status for indexing, vector sync, and failures.

Treat this as a production product, not a demo notebook.

## Repository Layout

- Root repo: GitHub staging/work area.
- Databricks product folder: `pa-appeals-and-policy-search - Databricks Product/`.
- Databricks app manifest: `pa-appeals-and-policy-search - Databricks Product/app.yaml`.
- App server: `pa-appeals-and-policy-search - Databricks Product/server/`.
- App client: `pa-appeals-and-policy-search - Databricks Product/client/`.
- Existing processor notebook: `pa-appeals-and-policy-search - Databricks Product/PA Appeals PDF Incremental Processor.ipynb`.
- Migration plan notebook: `pa-appeals-and-policy-search - Databricks Product/MIGRATION_PLAN.ipynb`.
- Databricks Genie handoff brief: `pa-appeals-and-policy-search - Databricks Product/DATABRICKS_GENIE_CHANGE_BRIEF.md`.

## Current Implemented State

The Databricks product folder has already been migrated from Python/Gradio to a Node.js, TypeScript, Express, React, and Vite Databricks App.

Implemented:

- `app.yaml` runs `npm run start`.
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` define the dependency contract.
- Express serves the API and built React client.
- Deterministic search engine supports:
  - terms,
  - phrases,
  - `AND`,
  - `OR`,
  - `NOT`,
  - `NEAR(n)`,
  - `ONEAR(n)`,
  - wildcard/truncation such as `administrat*`,
  - frequency syntax such as `ATLEAST3(procurement)`.
- Semantic search proxy route exists:
  - `POST /api/semantic-search`.
- Admin routes exist:
  - `GET /api/admin/stats`,
  - `POST /api/admin/refresh`,
  - `GET /api/admin/status/:runId`.
- React UI includes:
  - Search/Admin tabs,
  - deterministic/semantic mode toggle,
  - query history,
  - grouped results,
  - Admin panel for stats, refresh, and run status.

Old files removed from the Databricks product folder:

- `app.py`,
- `requirements.txt`,
- empty migration Markdown placeholders.

## Current Databricks Assets

Known existing assets from the migration plan:

- App name: `pa-appeals-and-policy-search`
- Current PDF volume: `/Volumes/tws_ro_region5/rcd/pa_second_appeals`
- Current Vector/AI Search index: `tws_ro_region5.rcd.pa_appeals_chunks_vs_index`
- Current chunks table: `tws_ro_region5.rcd.pa_appeals_chunks_vs`
- Current Vector Search endpoint: `pa-appeals-search-endpoint`
- Databricks host: `https://adb-5672234203219303.3.azuredatabricks.net`
- Processor notebook workspace path: `/Users/0492734585@fema.dhs.gov/pa-appeals-and-policy-search/PA Appeals PDF Incremental Processor`

Do not move or rename the processor notebook unless the user explicitly asks and the downstream Power Automate/job dependencies are accounted for.

## Critical Engineering Rules

- Forward the caller's `X-Forwarded-Access-Token` for semantic search and admin actions. Do not replace it with an app-level service principal token.
- Do not hard-code secrets, personal access tokens, warehouse credentials, or private account values outside explicit environment configuration.
- Keep generated artifacts out of source control:
  - `node_modules/`,
  - `client/dist/`,
  - `server/dist/`.
- Keep `package-lock.json` committed. Databricks should install dependencies from the lockfile.
- Preserve local demo/stub behavior when Databricks env vars are absent.
- Add or update tests when parser, search behavior, path handling, admin routes, or indexing logic changes.
- Keep UI professional and operational: clear status, errors, progress, and next actions.

## Major Known Gap

Semantic results currently come from Vector/AI Search chunks and include chunk/file/page data, but they do not yet reliably include all metadata needed to open the source PDF:

- `corpus_id`,
- `document_id`,
- `source_path`,
- `relative_path`,
- `page_number`,
- `chunk_id`.

Fixing this is essential before the semantic mode feels production-complete.

## Next Major Feature: Corpus Onboarding

The user wants an easy way to point the app at new stacks of PDFs and make them searchable by deterministic and semantic search with one button.

Implement this as governed corpus onboarding.

Core model:

- `Corpus`: one searchable stack of PDFs.
- `Document`: one PDF.
- `Page`: extracted page text.
- `Chunk`: semantic search unit.
- `Index Run`: operational history for ingestion/vector sync.

Recommended storage pattern:

- raw PDFs live in Unity Catalog Volumes or governed external volumes;
- extracted text and metadata live in Delta tables;
- semantic search indexes the chunks Delta table;
- both deterministic and semantic search filter by `corpus_id`.

Recommended tables:

- `search_corpora`
- `search_documents`
- `search_pages`
- `search_chunks`
- `search_index_runs`

Recommended UI addition:

- Admin tab section: `Add PDF Stack`
  - display name,
  - source path,
  - corpus id,
  - pilot/full mode,
  - validate path button,
  - index PDFs button,
  - run status/progress.

Recommended backend additions:

- `POST /api/admin/corpora/validate`
- `POST /api/admin/corpora/onboard`
- `GET /api/admin/corpora`
- `GET /api/admin/corpora/runs/:runId`

Recommended notebook/job additions:

- parameterize the indexing job with:
  - `SOURCE_PATH`,
  - `CORPUS_ID`,
  - `DISPLAY_NAME`,
  - `MODE`,
  - `FORCE_REINDEX`.
- recursively scan PDFs under the source path;
- create stable document ids from `corpus_id + relative_path`;
- extract page text;
- chunk text for semantic search;
- write/merge document, page, chunk, and run records;
- sync or create the Databricks AI Search index.

Recommended frontend additions:

- corpus selector in Search;
- search one corpus or all corpora;
- display corpus name in results;
- show corpus/index readiness state;
- disable or warn when a corpus is still indexing.

## Databricks Genie Usage

Use Databricks Genie or Databricks Assistant to inspect the live workspace, not to own the app implementation.

Ask Genie to confirm:

- which catalog/schema should own production search tables;
- whether the app has a resource named `sql-warehouse`;
- whether `X-Forwarded-Access-Token` is available in app requests;
- current chunks table schema;
- current AI Search index type and indexed columns;
- whether Change Data Feed is enabled where needed;
- exact permissions needed for volumes, SQL warehouse, AI Search, and Jobs API;
- whether an external volume is needed for non-Databricks PDF locations.

Then implement app/notebook changes in this repo.

## Validation Commands

Run from `pa-appeals-and-policy-search - Databricks Product/`:

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Known validation from the migration PR:

- `npm ci` passed.
- `npm test` passed.
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- `npm run build` passed outside the local sandbox.
- `npm ci` reported 5 dependency audit findings: 2 moderate and 3 high. Review deliberately; do not run forced upgrades blindly.

## Recommended Next Branch

Use a neutral branch name:

```text
feature/corpus-onboarding
```

Suggested commit title:

```text
Add governed PDF corpus onboarding
```

## Definition Of Done For Corpus Onboarding

- Admin can enter a governed Volume/external volume path.
- App validates that the caller can access the path.
- App submits an indexing job with source path and corpus id.
- Job creates/updates corpus, document, page, chunk, and run records.
- Semantic index includes enough metadata to open source PDFs from semantic hits.
- Search UI can filter by corpus.
- Deterministic and semantic search both work against the new corpus.
- Index status is visible and understandable to non-engineers.
- Tests cover parser/search changes and path-safety behavior.

# FEMA Advanced Search — Implementation Plan (2026-06)

The product is being reworked from "Appeals & Policy Research" into a polished,
FEMA-branded **FEMA Advanced Search** tool. This section is the living plan.

## Locked product decisions

- **Name:** `FEMA Advanced Search`. Page title, header, subtitle all use it.
- **Search modes:** keep the wording **Deterministic** and **Semantic** (not
  "Exact words / By meaning"). Westlaw-style operators (exact phrase, AND/OR/NOT,
  NEAR/ONEAR, wildcard, ATLEAST) stay gated behind an **Advanced search**
  disclosure, shown only in Deterministic mode.
- **Corpus model:** **one corpus now, config-driven**. A corpus = display name →
  chunks table (+ volume). Selector/ledger built to support many; ships with the
  single FEMA PA Second Appeals corpus. (No `corpus_id` column needed yet.)
- **Badge:** plain-language **wordmark** + simple magnifier glyph in DHS Blue. No
  official FEMA seal/logo (Branding SOP: custom marks need External Affairs
  approval). If an approved asset is provided, drop it in `FEMA Design/`.
- **Ledger fields (Phase 4):** core file metadata only — filename, relative
  path/folder, page count, file size, last-modified date.
- **Disclaimer (replaces "Pilot Boundaries"):** leads with "does not make
  eligibility determinations…"; shows "Last document added: «name» · «date»".

## FEMA / DHS design system (from `FEMA Design/`)

- **Palette** (decoded from `DHS Color Palette.ase`): primary **DHS Blue
  `#005288`** (ramps incl. `#003D67`, `#002B46`, `#D6E3EC`, `#F5F8FA`); **DHS Red
  `#C41230`**; DHS Light Blue `#0078AE`; DHS Green `#5E9732`; DHS gray/dark-gray
  scales. Tokens live in `client/src/styles.css :root`.
- **Typography:** **Merriweather** (DHS standard serif, SIL OFL) for headings,
  self-hosted from `/fonts` (no external CDN, keeps CSP `'self'`). Body = system
  sans (Public Sans fallback).
- **Accessibility:** Section 508 — maintain contrast, focus states, semantic HTML.

## Phased delivery

- **Phase 1 — FEMA design system + chrome** (DONE): rename, palette, Merriweather,
  wordmark, Deterministic/Semantic labels, Disclaimer + `GET /api/last-upload`.
- **Phase 2 — Usage counter** (CODE DONE, persistence pending grant): Deterministic
  /Semantic search totals, shown small in the footer. In-memory during the process
  lifetime; **debounce-flushed as JSON to a Volume** (not a table) set via the
  `USAGE_COUNTER_DIR` env var (e.g. `/Volumes/tws_ro_region5/rcd/advanced_search_data`).
  Endpoints: `GET /api/usage`; counts increment on successful `/api/search` and
  `/api/semantic-search`. Degrades gracefully to in-memory-only (resets on restart)
  when `USAGE_COUNTER_DIR` is unset or the SP lacks WRITE VOLUME — a later restart
  after the grant re-enables persistence. `snapshot().persisted` reports which mode
  is active.
- **Phase 3 — Corpus selector** (DONE): config-driven corpora; single corpus shows a
  static label, multiple show pills + "All"; `GET /api/corpora`; both search modes
  accept a `corpus` param; results carry corpus name when multi-corpus.
- **Phase 4 — Ledger tab** (CODE DONE, volume metadata pending grant): per-corpus
  file list (not chunks) — one row per document from the chunks table (filename,
  page count, chunk count), enriched with **file size + last-modified + folder from
  the volume listing** when the app SP can read it. `GET /api/ledger`; each row
  opens its source PDF in the viewer, shown only when a file is selected; a filter
  box narrows by name/folder. Size/modified render as "—" with an inline hint until
  `READ VOLUME` is granted (`MAX_LEDGER_ROWS` caps rows, default 5000).
- **Future (not now)**: translate corpus content to Spanish. Keep the data model
  translation-ready (a `language` dimension) for a clean future add.

## Permissions & identity model (IMPORTANT — see 2026-06 findings)

A Databricks App has **two identities**; getting features working means granting
the right one:

1. **App service principal (SP)** — configured under the app's **Resources**.
   Used for the app's own backend work and all **filesystem Volume reads/writes**
   (PDF preview, last-upload scan, the usage counter). Needs Unity Catalog grants.
2. **Forwarded user token** (`X-Forwarded-Access-Token`, OBO) — scopes configured
   under the app's **User authorization**. Used by code that forwards the caller's
   token (semantic search, admin Jobs calls). Per the Critical Engineering Rules,
   keep forwarding this token; do not substitute a static PAT.

### Grants the app SP needs

A Unity Catalog admin/owner of `tws_ro_region5` must grant these — the app owner
currently lacks `MANAGE` on the catalog:

- `USE CATALOG` on `tws_ro_region5`
- `USE SCHEMA` on `tws_ro_region5.rcd`
- `SELECT` on the chunks table(s) used for search
- `READ VOLUME` on `tws_ro_region5.rcd.pa_second_appeals` (preview / ledger / last-upload)
- `READ VOLUME` **and** `WRITE VOLUME` on `tws_ro_region5.rcd.advanced_search_data` (counter)
- Symptom if missing: "all account users lack USE CATALOG … user does not have
  MANAGE on the catalog to grant it to the app's service principal."

### User-authorization scopes the forwarded token needs

In app settings → User authorization → Add scope, then redeploy and re-consent:

- `sql`, `catalog.catalogs:read`, `catalog.schemas:read`, `catalog.tables:read`,
  `vector-search` — for SQL + semantic search.
- **`jobs`** — required for the Admin **Trigger Refresh** (jobs/runs/submit).
  Symptom if missing: `403 "Provided OAuth token does not have required scopes:
  jobs"`. If `jobs` is **not** an available user-authorization scope in the app
  UI, trigger the processor job via the **app SP** instead (add the job as an app
  resource with "Can manage run"); revisit the no-PAT rule with the owner first.

### Known-good vs blocked (2026-06)

- SQL / chunks read: working (SP "Can use" on `sql-warehouse` resource).
- Volume access: blocked until the SP gets USE CATALOG/USE SCHEMA/READ VOLUME.
- Admin refresh: 403 — forwarded token has no `jobs` scope (User authorization
  was empty). Add the scope (or move the trigger to the SP).
